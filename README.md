#The Gallery: Components

> Welcome to The Gallery!


In this first part of a **two-part** project, I’ll 
- assemble an image gallery for the Met Museum’s art collection. 


This gallery showcases a stunning array of artworks and invites interaction by 
- displaying existing comments for each piece and 
- allowing users to contribute their thoughts through a comment feature.

Throughout this project, I’ll 
1. practice my understanding of _Server Components_ and _Client Components_
2. utilize _Suspense Boundaries_ to create a seamless web application
